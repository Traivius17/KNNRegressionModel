# KNNRegressionModel

KNN Classification Model that uses NumPy framework and Pandas library with visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the correlations between the features and target data. 

The purpose of this model was to show the specified features that had the most correlation amongst the target data chosen within the model. The CSV file consisted of population data of midwest. The objective was to find what features of demographics would likely be reasonings behind what areas would be in poverty. 

Produces predictions for the model that allows us to determine if our model is good or bad. Based on this diagram of TrueValue, Prediction and Error, to determine if the was a good model. Also while producing plots to show what k values will produce the highest score.
